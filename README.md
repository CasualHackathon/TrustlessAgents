## üë®‚Äçüíª Who Should Join?

This isn't a bootcamp for beginners ‚Äî it's a high-bar, low-ego program designed for:

- **AI Agent & Ethereum Developers**: Expanding Ethereum's capabilities into decentralized AI
- **AI/ML Engineers & Researchers**: Building trustless, verifiable, and autonomous AI agents
- **Web3 Product Managers**: Exploring next-gen AI √ó ETH dApps and A2A architectures
- **AI Startups**: Share projects and insights with the community and foundations ‚Äî and connect with peers
- **Motivated Learners**: Dive into the frontier of AI √ó ETH

If you‚Äôre ready to:

* Dive into **ERC-8004** and build MVPs around it.
* Turn ideas into working code using the latest Ethereum features.
* Have fun and create something cool.

**This hackathon is for you.**

## üéÅ Awards and Prizes

- The greatest reward is the knowledge you gain ‚Äî and the chance to meet like-minded builders through their shared notes.
- Outstanding builders may be invited to demo on stage at **Devconnect Trustless Agent Day on Nov 21**.
- More benefits will be announced with partners!

### üöÄ Project Examples

- **ERC-8004 Trustless Agents Example**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vistara-apps/erc-8004-example)
- **Arena SDK**: With 8004 identities + A2A + ChaosChain integration for receipt logged on-chain and payment released on verification. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vistara-apps/agent-arena-v1)

Welcome to propose more ideas and examples!

## üß© Why ERC-8004? Why Now?

**ERC-8004** addresses key limitations of traditional AI agent systems while preserving their core strength: enabling trustless, verifiable, and economically autonomous AI agents.

Key benefits:

- ‚úÖ **Decentralized Identity** (works with existing Ethereum infrastructure)
- ‚úÖ **Highly extensible** (supports custom validation logic and reputation systems)
- ‚úÖ **Improved security model** (avoids centralized control and single points of failure)

This isn't just a fix ‚Äî it's a new design space for AI agents, dApps, security, identity, and permissions.

**Now** is the time to build, test, question, and innovate ‚Äî hands-on, from the ground up.
