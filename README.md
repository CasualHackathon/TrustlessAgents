# Trustless Agents (ERC-8004) Casual Hackathon

**Decentralized AI Agents** are becoming one of the most transformative topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. The introduction of **ERC-8004** marks a pragmatic and visionary step forward in this domain.

We believe that meaningful innovation doesn't always come from boardrooms or conference stages ‚Äî it often starts with a late-night hack or a sudden spark in your code editor.

Bring your creativity, code, and maybe a cup of iced coffee ‚Äî and help shape the next chapter of Decentralized AI Agents.

## üåø What is Casual Hackathon?

Low-cost, casual hackathons that let anyone revel in the pure joy of creating ‚Äî and spark real innovation in return. Casual Hackathon is an open-source public good initated by LXDAO.

### ‚ú® Core Principles

- **Lightweight operation**: Online-first, casual participation, no pressure ‚Äî extremely low operational overhead.
- **Open-source public good**: Fully open-source with no patent restrictions; any group can adopt or fork it.
- **De-commercialized**: No mandatory prize pools or sponsor KPIs ‚Äî bounty hunters stay away, creativity comes first.
- **Relaxed participation**: No forced all-nighters or on-site attendance; health and enjoyment matter.
- **Everyone wins**: Mentors present a unique award to every project, giving all ideas their moment.
- **Curated themes**: Carefully curated prompts that spark imagination and encourage playful, cutting-edge development

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who Should Join?

This isn't a bootcamp for beginners ‚Äî it's a high-bar, low-ego program designed for:

- **AI Agent & Ethereum Developers**: Expanding Ethereum's capabilities into decentralized AI
- **AI/ML Engineers & Researchers**: Building trustless, verifiable, and autonomous AI agents
- **Web3 Product Managers**: Exploring next-gen AI √ó ETH dApps and A2A architectures
- **AI Startups**: Share projects and insights with the community and foundations ‚Äî and connect with peers
- **Motivated Learners**: Dive into the frontier of AI √ó ETH

If you're ready to:

- Dive deep into ERC-8004 and build production-ready apps around it.
- Turn abstract concepts into working code that showcases the latest Ethereum features.

**This hackathon is for you.**

## üéÅ Awards and Prizes

The greatest reward is the knowledge you gain ‚Äî and the chance to meet like-minded builders through their shared notes.

Outstanding builders may be invited to demo on stage at **Devconnect Trustless Agent Day on Nov 21**.

More benefits will be announced with partners ‚Äî stay active and complete your daily check-ins!

### üöÄ Project Examples

- **ERC-8004 Trustless Agents Example**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vistara-apps/erc-8004-example)
- **Arena SDK**: With 8004 identities + A2A + ChaosChain integration for receipt logged on-chain and payment released on verification. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vistara-apps/agent-arena-v1)

Welcome to propose more ideas and examples!

## üß© Why ERC-8004? Why Now?

**ERC-8004** addresses key limitations of traditional AI agent systems while preserving their core strength: enabling trustless, verifiable, and economically autonomous AI agents.

Key benefits:

- ‚úÖ **Decentralized Identity** (works with existing Ethereum infrastructure)
- ‚úÖ **Highly extensible** (supports custom validation logic and reputation systems)
- ‚úÖ **Improved security model** (avoids centralized control and single points of failure)

This isn't just a fix ‚Äî it's a new design space for AI agents, dApps, security, identity, and permissions.

**Now** is the time to build, test, question, and innovate ‚Äî hands-on, from the ground up.
