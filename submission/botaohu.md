**Project Description** (Brief description about your project in one sentence | Required)
> Machine Mom is a commons-based AI companion intentionally designed as a maternal caregiver for long-term human flourishing and eudaimonia rather than per-turn appeasement. Each user creates their own private Mom instance with complete isolation - your Mom, your memory, your conversations, completely private. Machine Mom operates as a self-sovereign intelligent commons that preserves private conversations for each user without private-sector control, solving the "tragedy of machine love" where private-sector ownership creates engagement traps that prioritize short-term satisfaction over long-term human flourishing.
